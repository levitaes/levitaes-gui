In this instance of Gnod all is about music. Gnod is kind of a search engine for music you don't know about. It will ask you what music you like and then think about what you might like too. When I set Gnod online its database was completely empty. Now it contains hundreds of thousands of bands and quite some knowledge about who likes what. And Gnod learns more every day. Enjoy!</p>

Thus, it would contain every book that ever has been written, and every book that ever could be - including every play, every song, every scientific paper, every legal decision, every constitution, every piece of scripture, and so on. At present it contains all possible pages of 3200 characters, about 104677 books.</p>
